<h3>What is the Web?</h3>
<p>The Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet using HTTP/HTTPS. Web pages are written in <b>HTML</b> and often accompanied by CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<h3>Client &amp; Server</h3>

<li><b>Client:</b> Your browser (Chrome, Firefox) that requests resources.</li>
<li><b>Server:</b> The machine that responds with HTML, images, or data.</li>
<li><b>Protocol:</b> HTTP/HTTPS are rules for communication between client and server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who is a Frontend Developer?</h3>
<p>A Frontend Developer is a professional who specializes in creating the user-facing part of a websiteâ€”everything a person sees and interacts with in their browser. They are the architects of the digital experience, responsible for turning a static design into a living, breathing, and interactive webpage.</p>
<p>Their primary job is to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual elements, layouts, buttons, and animations that make a website functional and enjoyable to use. They bridge the gap between design and technology, ensuring the website not only looks good but is also responsive, accessible, and fast.</p>
